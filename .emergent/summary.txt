The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the development of the DUO Previa PWA. The initial phase focused on building the core MVP: a responsive menu with categories, a shopping cart, and WhatsApp checkout integration. This was achieved by a single  operation, modifying , , and . Backend API endpoints for the menu and cart were verified as fully functional. Frontend visuals were confirmed via screenshots, showing a professional and responsive UI. Upon user approval, the engineer proceeded to implement the admin dashboard and push notification system. This involved updating  and  on the backend, and creating , , and updating  on the frontend. The current state is that backend services have been restarted, and the backend testing for these new features has just commenced.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to create a Progressive Web App (PWA) for DUO Previa, a fast-food brand in CÃ³rdoba.
Initial requirements (MVP):
-   Responsive menu with categories (lomitos, burgers, empanadas).
-   Shopping cart with a delivery zone selector.
-   WhatsApp checkout button generating an order summary.
-   Admin dashboard for menu and availability management.
-   Web push notifications for opening hours/promotions.
-   Deployment to a custom domain.

Work completed for MVP:
-   A fully functional responsive menu and cart system with WhatsApp checkout has been implemented.
-   The backend APIs for menu and cart are confirmed working.
-   The frontend is visually appealing and responsive, displaying menu items with images and pricing.

Requested Enhancements:
-   **Admin Dashboard**: Secure login (email/password), dashboard panel with sidebar navigation, CRUD operations for menu items (name, price, image, category), management of delivery zones, viewing/filtering incoming orders (customer info, items, zone, timestamp). Must be mobile-friendly and connect to existing backend APIs.
-   **Push Notification System**: Admin can send manual notifications (text + link/image), optional scheduling, user subscription via browser permission. Uses standard PWA Push API.
-   **Design**: Maintain current red theme, Argentine branding, rounded components, and mobile responsiveness.
-   **Tech Notes**: React + Tailwind frontend, Context/Redux for state (if needed), existing REST APIs, localStorage/cookies for admin auth persistence (optional JWT).
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Technologies**: FastAPI (Python backend), React (JavaScript frontend), MongoDB (NoSQL database).
-   **PWA**: Progressive Web App features including manifest.json and Service Workers (sw.js) for push notifications and offline capabilities.
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern UI design.
-   **Service Management**: Supervisor for managing frontend and backend processes.
-   **API Communication**: Frontend uses , backend uses , all backend API routes are prefixed with .
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with separate backend and frontend directories.



-   : This is the core FastAPI application. Initially, it was set up with basic routes and CORS handling. It was then significantly updated to include menu item models, CRUD operations for menu and cart, and WhatsApp order summary generation. In the latest update, it has been further modified to incorporate admin authentication, and new API endpoints for managing menu items, delivery zones, orders, and push notification triggers, along with their respective database interactions.
-   : This file lists all Python dependencies for the FastAPI backend. It was updated to include necessary libraries for the new admin and push notification features (e.g., authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, etc.).
-   : This is the main React component. It initially contained the responsive menu, cart UI, and WhatsApp checkout integration. It has been extensively rewritten to include the admin dashboard layout, client-side routing, components for menu management, order viewing, delivery zone management, and logic for subscribing to and handling web push notifications. It dynamically fetches data from the backend.
-   : This file contains component-specific CSS styles. It was updated to reflect the new UI elements for the menu and cart, and subsequently for the admin dashboard, ensuring a consistent theme and responsive design with Tailwind CSS.
-   : This new file contains the Service Worker logic essential for PWA features like caching and push notifications. It handles registration, push event listening, and displaying notifications. An ESLint error regarding 'clients' being undefined was noted upon its creation.
-   : This new file defines the PWA's metadata, including app name, icons, start URL, and display mode, crucial for web app installation and a native app-like experience.

</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Address the ESLint error () in .
-   Complete backend testing for admin dashboard and push notification features.
-   Frontend testing for the admin dashboard and push notification features is pending user approval.
-   Implement remaining PWA features (offline capability).
-   General polish and performance optimization.
-   Deployment setup.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed the implementation of the admin dashboard and push notification system. This involved significant updates to both the backend and frontend. On the backend,  was modified to include new routes for admin login, menu item management (add, edit, delete), delivery zone management, order viewing, and an endpoint for triggering push notifications. The  file was updated to reflect new Python dependencies.

On the frontend,  was rewritten to incorporate the admin dashboard UI, including navigation, forms for managing menu items and delivery zones, and displays for orders. Two new files were created in :  for the Service Worker handling push notifications, and  for PWA metadata.

After these file writes, both frontend and backend services were restarted. The current activity is the initiation of backend testing for all the newly added features related to the admin dashboard and push notifications using , as indicated by the final chat message: Now let me test the backend with all the new admin and push notification features:.
